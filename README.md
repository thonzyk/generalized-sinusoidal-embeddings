# generalized-sinusoidal-embeddings
Generalized sinusoidal positional embeddings for arbitrary N-D data. Extends the Transformer’s fixed sin/cos encoding to 2D, 3D, and beyond (images, video, volumes). Automatically allocates frequency bands across dimensions and adapts the frequency schedule to the number of embedding channels. Lightweight, framework-agnostic implementation.
